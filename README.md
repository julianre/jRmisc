# jRmisc

## Overview

I wrote this package to store my modified `ggplot2` theme (`theme_jr`). While I was at it, I addad a function to format percantages (`percentjr`, adds thin space between the number and the percent sign).

## Installation

``` r
# The easiest way to get jRmisc is to install it from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("julianre/jRmisc")
```
