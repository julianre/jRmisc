# jRmisc

## Overview

I wrote this package to store my modified `ggplot2` theme (`theme_jr`). While I was at it, I added a function to format percentages (`percentjr`, adds thin space between the number and the percent sign). It also includes a custumized version of `Session_Info`, which displays the version of Pandoc, pandoc-citeproc and [pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref), if it is used within an RMarkdown document.

## Installation

``` r
# The easiest way to get jRmisc is to install it from GitHub:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("julianre/jRmisc")
```
